# ADR-001: Payment System Architecture for Supplier Management

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-10-15  
**Authors:** Ricardo Valadez  
**Stakeholders:** Engineering Team, Product Team, Finance Team  

## Context

We need to design a payment processing architecture for our supplier management system that handles:
- Multiple payment methods (bank transfers, checks, digital wallets)
- Multi-currency transactions for international suppliers
- Scheduled and batch payment processing
- Integration with existing ERP systems
- Compliance with financial regulations (PCI DSS, SOX)
- Real-time payment status tracking and notifications

### Current State
- Manual payment processing through spreadsheets
- No automated reconciliation
- Limited audit trails
- High error rates in payment scheduling
- Lack of real-time visibility into payment status

### Business Requirements
- Process 1000+ supplier payments monthly
- Support 15+ currencies
- 99.9% uptime requirement
- Sub-second payment status queries
- Complete audit trail for compliance

## Decision

We will implement a **microservices-based payment architecture** with the following components:

### Core Services
1. **Payment Orchestration Service** (Node.js)
   - Handles payment workflow coordination
   - Manages business rules and validation
   - Integrates with external payment providers

2. **Payment Provider Gateway** (Python)
   - Abstracts multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Bank APIs)
   - Handles provider-specific formatting and protocols
   - Implements circuit breaker pattern for resilience

3. **Transaction Management Service** (C#)
   - Manages payment state and lifecycle
   - Handles idempotency and duplicate detection
   - Provides real-time status tracking

4. **Compliance & Audit Service** (Python)
   - Logs all payment activities
   - Generates compliance reports
   - Manages data retention policies

### Data Architecture
- **PostgreSQL** for transactional data (ACID compliance)
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Amazon S3** for document storage and archival
- **Event streaming** via AWS SQS for service communication

### Security Implementation
- OAuth 2.0 for API authentication
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently based on load
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others
- **Maintainability**: Clear service boundaries and responsibilities
- **Compliance**: Built-in audit trails and security controls
- **Integration**: Clean APIs for ERP and third-party integrations
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput batch processing

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency challenges
- **Deployment**: More complex CI/CD pipeline requirements
- **Debugging**: Distributed tracing required for troubleshooting

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Service Dependencies**: Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- **Data Synchronization**: Use event sourcing for critical state changes
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (Months 1-2)
- Set up core infrastructure (databases, message queues)
- Implement Payment Orchestration Service
- Basic integration with primary payment provider

### Phase 2 (Months 3-4)
- Add Transaction Management Service
- Implement real-time status tracking
- Basic compliance logging

### Phase 3 (Months 5-6)
- Full Compliance & Audit Service
- Multiple payment provider support
- Advanced monitoring and alerting

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: <200ms average response time for payment initiation
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with automated failover
- **Processing Volume**: Handle 10,000+ transactions per day
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% payment processing failures
- **Compliance**: Zero compliance violations in first year

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier debugging
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, harder to scale specific components
- **Verdict**: Rejected due to scalability requirements

### Third-Party Payment Platform (Stripe Connect)
- **Pros**: Faster implementation, built-in compliance
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited customization, higher transaction fees
- **Verdict**: Considered for future integration but not primary solution

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pros**: Ultimate decoupling, excellent scalability
- **Cons**: Complex event ordering, steep learning curve
- **Verdict**: Elements incorporated but not full implementation
